# Polyhedral Maze

Interactive 3D maze generator on the surfaces of convex polyhedra.

Generate perfect mazes (unique-solution spanning trees) on all 5 Platonic, all
13 Archimedean, all 13 Catalan, the 5 non-Platonic convex deltahedra, and 10
uniform prisms & antiprisms — 46 shapes in total — and explore them in an
interactive 3D viewer.

## Features

- **46 polyhedra** across five categories:
  - **Platonic (5)**: tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron
  - **Archimedean (13)**: cuboctahedron, icosidodecahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, truncated tetrahedron / cube / octahedron / cuboctahedron / dodecahedron / icosahedron / icosidodecahedron, snub cube, snub dodecahedron
  - **Catalan (13)**: triakis tetrahedron / octahedron / icosahedron, tetrakis hexahedron, pentakis dodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, rhombic triacontahedron, deltoidal icositetrahedron / hexecontahedron, disdyakis dodecahedron / triacontahedron, pentagonal icositetrahedron / hexecontahedron
  - **Deltahedra (5)** — the non-Platonic convex deltahedra: triangular bipyramid, pentagonal bipyramid, snub disphenoid (J84), triaugmented triangular prism (J51), gyroelongated square bipyramid (J17)
  - **Prismatic (10)** — uniform prisms and antiprisms: triangular / pentagonal / hexagonal / octagonal / decagonal prism, square / pentagonal / hexagonal / octagonal / decagonal antiprism
- **7 face-type grids** (rectangular, triangular, kite, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, decagonal) that compose freely on mixed-face solids
- **3 maze algorithms**: Kruskal, DFS backtracker, Wilson (loop-erased random walk)
- **Warp tunnels**: shortcut through the polyhedron connecting opposite faces
- **Interactive 3D viewer**: rotate, zoom, auto-rotate, and inspect the maze on the surface
- **URL sharing**: any maze configuration is reproducible via URL parameters
- **PDF export**: download unfolded net diagrams (puzzle + answer) for paper craft
